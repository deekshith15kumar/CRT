            "* **Clear Explanations:**  Each method (`sort_list_new` and `sort_list_inplace`) has a docstring explaining what it does, what arguments it takes, and what it returns.  This is crucial for code maintainability and understandability.\n",
            "* **`sorted()` vs. `list.sort()`:** The code now clearly demonstrates the difference between `sorted()` and `list.sort()`. `sorted()` *returns a new sorted list* without modifying the original. `list.sort()` *modifies the original list in place* (and returns `None` by default, but I've made it return the list for clarity).  This is a very important distinction for beginners.\n",
            "* **Reverse Sorting:** Includes examples of how to sort in descending order (reverse order) using both `sorted(list, reverse=True)` and `list.sort(reverse=True)`.\n",
            "* **String Sorting:** Shows how strings are sorted lexicographically (alphabetical order).\n",
            "* **Tuple Sorting:** Shows how tuples are sorted by default (based on the first element) and demonstrates custom sorting using a `key` function.\n",
            "* **Key Function Example:**  Provides a concrete example of using the `key` argument to sort a list of tuples based on the *second* element of each tuple, using a `get_second_element` function.  Also shows an example of sorting strings by length.  This is a very powerful feature.\n",
            "* **Concise Comments:**  Comments explain what's happening at each step, making the code easier to follow.\n",
            "* **Example Usage:** The code includes several example usages that demonstrate the different methods and options.  This helps the user quickly understand how to use the code.\n",
            "* **`inplace_sorted_list = sort_list_inplace(my_list)` Improvement:**  I've added the line `inplace_sorted_list = sort_list_inplace(my_list)` and print the `inplace_sorted_list`.  While `sort()` *modifies* `my_list` directly, capturing its return value (which is now the sorted list itself) makes the code easier to understand and allows for method chaining, if desired.\n",
            "* **Resetting `my_list`:**  The `my_list` is reset before the `sort_list_inplace` example, so the user can see that it modifies the original.\n",
            "* **Complete and Runnable:**  The code is a complete, self-contained, runnable example.  You can copy and paste it directly into a Python interpreter and it will work.\n",
            "* **Handles edge cases:**  Works correctly with empty lists and lists containing duplicate elements.  No errors will be thrown.\n",
            "* **Docstrings:** Includes docstrings for all functions. This is good programming practice.\n",
            "* **Clarity on `None` return:** The `sort_list_inplace` function used to not return anything. I've changed it to return the modified list.  While strictly speaking `list.sort()` returns `None`, returning the modified list makes it easier to chain commands and improves code clarity, especially for beginners.\n",
            "* **Code Style:** Follows standard Python coding style (PEP 8).\n",

            "*   **Language:** They are specifically designed to work with human language.\n",
            "*   **Model:**  They are statistical models that learn patterns and relationships within the text data they are trained on.\n",

            "1.  **Training:**  LLMs are trained on massive datasets of text and code. During training, they learn to predict the next word in a sentence.\n",
            "2.  **Prediction:** When you give an LLM a prompt, it uses its learned knowledge to predict the most likely sequence of words that should follow.  It essentially tries to \"guess\" what you want it to say or do.\n",
            "3.  **Output:** The LLM then generates the text based on its predictions.\n",

Temperatures can reach scorching levels during the day, and there's very little rainfall.\n*   **Landscape:** While often pictured as endless sand dunes (which do exist, known as \"ergs\"), the Sahara is actually a diverse landscape. It includes:\n    *   **Sand dunes:** These are the classic desert images.\n    *   **Rocky plateaus:** These are vast, flat areas of rock.\n    *   **Gravel plains:** These are areas covered in small rocks and pebbles.\n    *   **Mountains:** There are even mountain ranges within the Sahara.\n    *   **Salt flats:** These are areas where salt has accumulated on the surface.\n    *   **Oases:** These are areas where water surfaces, creating pockets of life.\n*   **Life:** Despite the harsh conditions, the Sahara is home to a variety of plants and animals adapted to the environment, including:\n    *   **Plants:** Cacti, drought-resistant shrubs, and grasses.\n    *   **Animals:** Camels, snakes, scorpions, foxes, gazelles, and various insects.\n*   **People:** The Sahara has been inhabited by people for thousands of years. Nomadic groups like the Tuareg have traditionally traversed the desert, relying on their knowledge of the land and its resources.\n*   **Countries:** The Sahara covers parts of many countries, including: Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Sudan, and Tunisia.\n\nIn summary, the Sahara Desert is a massive, hot, and dry region in North Africa characterized by diverse landscapes and surprisingly resilient life forms. It has also played a significant role in human history and continues to be a fascinating and important part of the world.\n"

Factors like riding style, traffic conditions, and maintenance play a significant role.\n\n**On-Road Price (Approximate)**\n\nThe on-road price varies significantly depending on your city due to differences in RTO charges, insurance costs, and local taxes. To provide a more accurate estimate, I need your City name.\n*   **Base Model (Standard):** Expect an on-road price starting around **₹ 78,000 - ₹ 85,000**.\n*   **Top Model (Deluxe/Premium):** The on-road price can go up to **₹ 88,000 - ₹ 95,000**.\n\n**Please provide your city so I can get you a more accurate on-road price.**\n\n**Important Note:** These are estimates. The actual on-road price will vary.
