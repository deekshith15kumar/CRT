            "* **Core Concept:** Learning from data to make predictions or improve performance on a specific task.  The process involves applying algorithms to data to create a model that can then be used for prediction.\n",

            "* **Speech Recognition:**  Powering virtual assistants like Siri and Google Assistant.\n",
            "* **Web Search:** Improving search engine results using algorithms like Naive Bayes.\n",

            "    * **Regression:** Predicting continuous outcomes (e.g., house price).\n",
            "* **Unsupervised Learning:** The training data lacks labels.  The model aims to discover patterns and structure in the data.  Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.\n",
